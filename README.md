This will be a learning project of a beginner web developer. Hopefully the skills I have learned (Basic HTML and CSS) will allow me to complete this task in a timely manner. Nevertheless, a lot of googling is awaiting me!
This README file will also contain a summary when I am finished with the task.

Finished Page Update:
This task proved to be quite challenging for a new web developer like myself, but in the end I managed to build something that looks very similar to the original. There are still some things that I would add or change, however I think this project's time has come to an end as I don't see too much value in seeking even more details.
The greatest lesson that I've learned is that at this stage google really is your best friend. All my issues have come up in the past, so if I search enough I will find the answers I need. Furthermore, I've understood that it is false to think that you have an unsolvable problem; you just need more time.
My next plan is to gain the freeCodeCamp certification and we will see it from there!
